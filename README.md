# Project_3

# Procedure

- Autogeneration of NFT
 
 The generation of the specific NFT was created using the following code

`background = ["Blue", "Orange"]`
`background_weights = [30,15]`

`circle = ["Blue", "Orange"]`
`circle_weights = [30,15]`

`square = ["Blue", "Orange"]`
`square_weights = [30,15]`


`#Creating dictionary variables for the traits`

`background_files = {` 
    `"Blue" : "blue",`
    `"Orange" : "orange",`
`}`

`square_files = {`
    `"Blue" : "blue-square",`
    `"Orange" : "orange-square",`
`}`

`circle_files = {`
    `"Blue" : "blue-circle",`
    `"Orange" : "orange-circle",`
`}`
